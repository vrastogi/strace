The compilation of strace with backtrace support is a bit problematic. Here is
what should be done.

Build libunwind according to instructions:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check # two test cases will fail and that is expected

The resulting libraries are in src/.libs, where we should add another symbolic
link to satisfy the configure scripts of strace. This symlinking was painful to
figure out.

$ ln -s libunwind-x86_64.so libunwind-generic.so

Now, we are ready to compile strace. We need to use the bootstrap script.

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --with-libunwind=../libunwind LDFLAGS=-L../libunwind/src/.libs
$ make

Obviously, we assume in the above that libunwind root at ../libunwind.

ldd shows that the strace binary depends on libunwind.so.8,
libunwind-x86_64.so.8, and libunwind-ptrace.so.0. These libraries must be
provided to the environment either by placing in standard locations, by
defining an appropriate LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or some other way.

Note that I could not get `make check` working in the build environment. All
test cases failed; the likely reason is that libunwind libraries were not found
while running test cases.
